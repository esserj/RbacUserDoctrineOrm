        'ZfcUser',
        'ZfcUserDoctrineORM',
        'RbacUserDoctrineOrm',
     ```
  6. Install or Update database
  
  To install database run this commande :
  ```php
  	.\vendor\bin\doctrine orm:clear-cache:metadata
	.\vendor\bin\doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
  ```
  
  To update database run this commande :
    ```php
  	.\vendor\bin\doctrine-module orm:schema-tool:update --force
  ```
  
  7. setup doctrine database parameters by adding the following to your `my/project/config/autoload/local.php`:
  
     ```php
        'doctrine' => array(
            'connection' => array(
                // default connection name
                'orm_default' => array(
                    'driverClass' => 'Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOMySql\Driver',
                    'params' => array(
                        'host'     => 'localhost',
                        'port'     => '3306',
                        'user'     => '', //put your user here
                        'password' => '', //put your pass here
                        'dbname'   => '', //put your database here
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    ```
  8. see the ZfcUser & ZfcRbac pages for controller/view plugins to get started
     
## Providers

Providers are listeners that hook into various events to provide roles and permissions. ZfcRbac ships with
several providers that you can use out of the box, but none support ORM, this is where we come in:

  - Generic Providers:
    - Permissions & Roles (RbacUserDoctrineOrm\Provider\AdjacencyList\Role): uses Doctrine ORM to inject Role entities that have permission entities compatible with the ZfcRbac RoleInterface
